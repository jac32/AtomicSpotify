# A Simple Spotify Client in Atom

AtomicSpotify allows you to interact with the Spotify client without leaving the atom text editor.

The following commands are added to the command palette:

    
  
  - `Spotify: Current Track'`
  - `Spotify: Play/Pause`
  - `Spotify: Play Next`
  - `Spotify: Play Prev`
  - `Spotify: Play Selection`
  - `Spotify: Search Selection`
  - `Spotify: Increase Volume`
  - `Spotify: Decrease Volume`
    
  The output verbosity for all of these commands can be toggled with:
  
    `Spotify: Toggle Verbosity`


NOTE: This plugin will *only* work on OS X
